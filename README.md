# PowerShell Utilities

Contains most of my current PowerShell functions that I use for my workflow. Began this as a way to get into bash scripting, but built upon it, and now I have a bunch of functions that do what I want them do. 

Sharing it here partly as a back-up, and partly so I have something to link to if my utilities end up being useful for others.
